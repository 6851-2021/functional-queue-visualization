    structure. It consists solely of a pointer to the head of a one-way linked list,
    which contains the stackâ€™s elements from top to bottom. To push, we add a new
    element to the one-way linked list, and return the pointer to this new element.
    To pop, we return a pointer to the second element of the linked list.</>);
const info_queues = (<>Functional queues are a natural next step. Ideally, we would like to implement
                       them with a <i>constant</i> number of changes per enqueue/dequeue. This turns
                       out to be much harder than for stacks! But there is a solution: using our functional 
                       stacks as a black box, we can simulate each queue operation using a constant number of
                        operations on a set of six stacks. The primary goal of our visualizer is to show
                        these operations in action, and how they come together to make a functional queue.</>);
